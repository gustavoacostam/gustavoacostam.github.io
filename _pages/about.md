## About me

I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP). Since I was a student, I worked as a Research Assistant in several projects cleaning and analyzing administrative datasets in Peru. Upon graduation in 2018, I have been working at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), assisting and managing fieldwork activities of large scale RCTs in Peru and Paraguay. I am currently working as a Research Associate at Duke University on research projects with a focus on gender issues. My major interests are Development Economics, Labor, Health and Gender.
