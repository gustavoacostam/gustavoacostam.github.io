## About me

I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP). Since I was a student, I worked as a Research Assistant in several projects cleaning and analyzing administrative datasets in Peru. Upon graduation in 2018, I have been working at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), assisting and managing fieldwork activities of large scale RCTs in Peru and Paraguay. I am currently working as a Research Associate for professor [Erica Field](https://sites.duke.edu/ericafield/) on [research projects](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/training-local-leaders-prevent-gender-based-violence-peru) aimed at reducing violence against women in Peru. My major interests are Development Economics, Labor, Health and Gender.
