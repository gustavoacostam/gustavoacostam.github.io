## About me

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on Development Economics, Global Health Economics, and Labor Economics, with projects in Ghana, Malawi, Peru, and Uganda. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow in Economics at Duke University, where I worked on labor and health projects in Pakistan and Peru. Before that, I served as a Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action in Paraguay and Peru.
