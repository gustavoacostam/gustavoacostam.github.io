## About me

I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow in Economics at Duke University, where I work with professors Erica Field, Robert Garlick, Kate Vyborny, and Livia Schubiger on labor and health projects in Pakistan and Peru. Previously, I was a Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action in Paraguay and Peru working on research projects related to gender-based violence, poverty, financial inclusion, and machine learning. My major research interests hover around applied microeconomics, development, labor, health, behavioral, and gender.
